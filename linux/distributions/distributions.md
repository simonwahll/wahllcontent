## Alpine Linux

Very minimal. Runs fast and is based on musl libc and busybox.

## Arch Linux

Not a light weight but not a heavy distribution either. Perfect for the person who wants to configure their own system and wants recent (possibly not as stable) packages.

## Debian

Very stable. Default installation images install a lot of uneccassary packages. I would recommend to install the minimal version and then install the packages you want yourself.
